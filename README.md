# Chronicles of Code Slinger

# 01 Overview
The objective of the project was to tell a story using code. The purpose was to utilize storytelling as a introduction and guide to a deeper understanding of  coding and the language of. Our team of developers created a story about a quiet coder that evloves into a superhero to demonstrate a symbol of hope, and represent the idea that anyone can be a hero. The project was divided into two parts, the first part being the command line interface, that included backend coding only and then the swiftui storyboard where we designed an interface for the story. 

# 02 Command Line Interface Objectives
- Become familiar with Variables, Constants, Conditionals and basic operators, Functions, Arrays, Loops, Structs, Enums, and optionals.
- Collaborate with coders and designers to find ways to implement the primitive, compound, and user defined types to create expressions in our code.
-  Test code to find any inconsistencies.
-  Discover and practice creative ways to utilize code to tell a story.

# Challenges
- The first challenge to overcome was the implementation of loops in our story because of lack of repitition in the plot. With a new understanding of loops and how to use them it took a combination of research and a creative approach to coding and storytelling to find a solution. The solution we came to was utilizing the narraration to create a reoccuring line in the story in order to implement loops.

- Another challenge we faced as a team was understanding how to utilize conditional statements in the story without drastically changing the plot of the story. The way we overcame that challenge was doing diffferent guiding activities to understanding conditional statements beyond the initial confusion. For example we reviewed, discussed, and took note of previous projects that utilized the concepts we wanted to understand, which was extremely helpful.

# SwiftUI Objectives

- Become familiar with @State and user input, and navigation.
- Implement @State and user input, and navigation to express the story in Xcode.
- Design lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes of Code Slinger app.
- Take Hi-Fi specifications and translate to Xcode app.
- Collaboration with coders and designers to bring our Hi-Fi prototype to life.
- Test UI and UX through documentation.
- Test code to find any inconsistencies.
